  <h2>The H1-B Problem </h2>

      Immigration (or ensuring the lack of it) has been one of the primary, and arguably most contentious, focuses of Donald Trump's presidency. Given the administration's 'Buy American,Hire American' battlecry, it come to no one's suprise that the H-1B program, the most popular type of work visas, is now under heavy scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
      The H-1B Work Visa Program was created primarily to welcome foreign enterpreneurs and workers with specialized skills to contribute and fill the skill gap in the American Economy. For years, the H-1B visa have provided a way for foreign nationals to experience the American Dreams. While for some of the lucky ones, the H-1B visa even provided the first step towards being American. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Given the popular nature of the program, the US government imposed a 60,000 cap on the number of H-1B visa it can issue every year, with additional 20,000 exemptions given to foreign nationals with master's and higher degree from U.S. universities and full exemption given to foreign nationals working on non-profit and academic organizations. On the years when the cap is reached, the US government will randomly fill in the quota through the <strong>lottery system</strong>. The lottery system might have looked fair on the surface, ensuring equal chance of approval amongst applicants, however,

        Despite the open nature of the program, top 10 country of origins for H-1B visa beneficiaries have been virtually unchanged in the past 20 years. In the following graph, it can be seen that H-1B workers from China in 2016 have more than double their number in 2006. However, this 100% increase in Chinese workers in the past 10 years are nothing compared to the number of Indian workers that historically have majorly benefitted from the H1-B program.

      The abundance of applications from India might be understandable if we take into account that most 'specialized skills' jobs are in the STEM field and India is known for their numerous advancements in the STEM field and education. However, a deeper dive in to the data reveals a disturbing trend in which historically more than 40% of H-1B visa approved on average are concentrated around 20 companies, from which 13 are IT outsourcing companies. In fact, outsoucing companies have been accused in multiple occasions that it have taken  the wrong advantage out of the lottery system and flood the quota in order to improve the odds of their applicants getting accepted, at the cost of the decrease in chances for other candidates from smaller companies that are really in need of specialized skills workers. Outsourcing companies are also more likely to pay lower wages than other types of H-1B patron companies, which is where most accusations towards the visa program came from.
